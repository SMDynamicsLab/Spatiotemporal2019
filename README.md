# Spatiotemporal2019

This repository is organized in two folders as follows:

- **experiments**: contains the necessary code to experiment with spatial and temporal perturbations using two Arduinos.

- **data_analysis**: contains the code to perform the processing of data collected with the experimental setup, and code and data to reproduce all figures in LÃ³pez, S. L., & Laje, R. (2019), "Spatiotemporal perturbations in paced finger tapping suggest a common mechanism for the processing of time errors". *Scientific reports*, 9(1), 1-15.

For further instructions, see the specific readme file in each folder.
